In this laboratory, which is a sub-laboratory of IVP laboratories, different implementations of artificial neural networks concepts is shared.

In a nutshell, the main goal of us and our workshop is making you get familiar with artificial intelligence concepts using Python programming language. We also attempted to use other libraries which are used frequently in artificial intelligence field such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and PyTorch.<br /> 

The below image illustrates our workshops road map.
